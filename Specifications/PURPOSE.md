#Purpose

The purpose of Chainmedia is to create an open source private and secure social media platform. In the light of leaks and biased moderation, this platform will be built to achieve certain goals:

* No monetization of platform. Ever. No advertising. No data brokering. User data will not be sold in any sense.

* No cleartext. Every transaction will be encrypted. User data will be worthless in the event of a breach or federal intrusion. 

* Build Webs of Trust. Along with key-signing, webs of trust will be used to identify overlapping social groups.

* Trust the webs. Each user will be assigned a cryptocoin in the form of an expendible token. Microtoken interactions (commenting on a feed outside your web of trust, or adding trust in a public figure for example) will limit the amount of damage that new and shadow-puppet accounts can create.
